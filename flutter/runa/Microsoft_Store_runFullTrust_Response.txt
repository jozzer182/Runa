Why do you need the runFullTrust capability, and how will it be used in your product?

Our application "runa es" is built with Flutter for Windows, which inherently requires runFullTrust capability due to technical limitations of the Flutter framework. Here's why:

TECHNICAL NECESSITY:
• Flutter for Windows compiles to Win32 native applications (.exe), not UWP apps
• Flutter uses the Skia graphics engine which requires low-level Windows API access
• The MSIX packaging tool automatically adds runFullTrust for Flutter Windows apps
• It's technically impossible to create a Flutter Windows app without runFullTrust

SPECIFIC USE CASES:
• Firebase integration: Connects to Firestore for motivational phrase synchronization
• Firebase AI (Gemini): Generates personalized motivational content
• Local data storage: Implements offline fallback system for phrases and user preferences
• System integration: Notifications, regional settings, and Windows theme adaptation

SECURITY MEASURES:
• Only uses minimal required capabilities: internetClient + runFullTrust
• No access to sensitive user data (camera, microphone, location, personal files)
• File access limited to application directory only
• Network access restricted to Firebase services only

ALTERNATIVES EVALUATED:
• Attempted to package without runFullTrust - technically impossible with Flutter
• UWP development not supported by Flutter framework
• Web technologies would compromise offline functionality and native performance

The runFullTrust capability is used responsibly and is the minimum requirement for Flutter Windows applications to function properly in the Microsoft Store ecosystem.
